*Disclaimer:* _Apache Trafodion is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by 
the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that 
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other 
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF._
