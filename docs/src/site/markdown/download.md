This page describes how you download and install the Trafodion product environment.  Please refer to [Create Development Environment](create-dev-environment.html) if you want to set up a Trafodion development environment (which includes the installation of a stand-alone Hadoop environment) based on the Trafodion source code.

# Prerequisite
Trafodion is installed onto an existing Hadoop environment. Currently, one of the following environments are required:

* Cloudera CDH 5.2
* Cloudera CDH 5.3
* Hortonworks HDP 2.2.

We're actively working on removing this restriction.

# Download
The Trafodion end-user environment is installed using the Trafodion Installer, which operates on Trafodion binaries only.

## Binaries
The Trafodion binaries are available as a tar file. 

### 1.3.0 Binaries

* [Trafodion Installer](http://traf-builds.esgyn.com/downloads/trafodion/publish/release/1.3.0/apache-trafodion-installer-1.3.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz)
