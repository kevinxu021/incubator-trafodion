First of all, a big **Thank You** from us for evaluating and/or using our products. We truly appreciate it! Our products exist and continues to improve thanks to you. But you can help us and yourself more!

We are a community of volunteers working with the guidelines and policies of the Apache Software Foundation (the Apache Way) in mind. Therefore, we welcome any kind of input you can provide to create better products. These contributions, whether you think of reporting bugs, supplying code enhancements, improvements to our documentation, answering questions in our mailing lists, or anywhere else are valuable to us. Because these will help us in helping you.

Your first step toward more involvement in our project is to subscribe to one of our [mailing lists](mail-lists.html). Next, please consider making your first contribution by simply sending an e-mail to our community discussing; for example:

* What you like about Trafodion and its documentation.
* What you find missing.
* A bug you encountered.

Or, help us by writing articles, blog posts, or sharing information about Trafodion at conferences and on social media such as Twitter (\#trafodion).

1. Send an email to the dev mailing list of the project stating that you, as a contributor, want to do more and be listed on the Team page. Any community member with edit permissions to the source code can then add your details to the list. 
2. Send your [**ICLA**](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt) to the secretary of the Apache Software Foundation. Refer to the [Licenses](http://www.apache.org/licenses/) page for information about this requirement.
