= Execute SPJs

This chapter describes how to execute SPJs by using the CALL statement
and assumes that you have already registered the SPJs in the Trafodion
database and that you have granted privileges to execute the SPJs to the
appropriate database users. For information, see
<<deploy-spj-jar-files, Deploy SPJ JAR Files>>
and <<create-spjs, Create SPJs>>.

This chapter covers these topics:

* <<required-privileges-for-calling-an-spj, Required Privileges for Calling an SPJ>>
* <<transaction-behavior, Transaction Behavior>>
* <<multithreading, Multithreading>>
* <<using-the-call-statement, Using the CALL Statement>>

* <<calling-spjs-from-a-jdbc-client-application, Calling SPJs From a JDBC Client Application>>
* <<calling-an-spj-in-a-trigger, Calling an SPJ in a Trigger>>

The CALL statement invokes an SPJ in the database. You can issue a CALL
statement from any of these applications or interfaces supported by the
Trafodion platform:

* trafci command-line interface or script file
* JDBC Type-4 client applications
* ODBC client applications

You can use a CALL statement as a stand-alone SQL statement in
applications or in command-line interfaces, such as trafci. You can also
use a CALL statement in a trigger but not inside a compound statement or
with rowsets. The SPJ that you use in a trigger must not have any OUT or
INOUT parameters or return any result sets.

== Required Privileges for Calling an SPJ

To execute the CALL statement, you must have the EXECUTE privilege on
the procedure. For more information, see
<<grant-privileges, Grant Privileges>>.

== Transaction Behavior

The stored procedure's transaction attribute determines whether it
inherits the transaction from the calling application (TRANSACTION
REQUIRED) or whether it runs without inheriting the calling
application's transaction (NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED). The transaction
attribute is set during the creation of the stored procedure. For more
information, see the Transaction Required attribute in
<<create-a-procedure, Create a Procedure>>.

Typically, you want the stored procedure to inherit the transaction
from the calling application. See <<transaction-required, Transaction Required>>.
However, if the SPJ method does not access the database or if you want the
stored procedure to manage its own transactions, you should set the stored
procedure's transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED.
See <<no-transaction-required>>.

=== Transaction Required

If you want the SPJ method to inherit the transaction from the calling
application, set the stored procedure's transaction attribute to
TRANSACTION REQUIRED (the default setting) when creating the stored
procedure. For more information, see the Transaction Required attribute
in link:#_bookmark116["Create a]
link:#_bookmark116[Procedure" (page 37)]. When a stored procedure's
transaction attribute is TRANSACTION REQUIRED, a CALL statement
automatically initiates a transaction if there is no active transaction.

==== Using Transaction Control Statements or Methods

If you select Yes for the Transaction Required attribute when creating a
stored procedure, you should not use transaction control statements (or
equivalent JDBC transaction methods) in the SPJ method. Transaction
control statements include COMMIT WORK and ROLLBACK WORK, and the
equivalent JDBC transaction methods are Connection.commit() and
Connection.rollback(). If you try to use transaction control statements
or methods in an SPJ method when the stored procedure's transaction
attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED, the transaction control
statements or methods in the SPJ method are ignored, and the Java
virtual machine (JVM) does not report any errors or warnings. When the
stored procedure's transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED,
you should rely on the transaction control statements or methods in the
application that calls the stored procedure and allow the calling
application to manage the transactions.

===== Committing or Rolling Back a Transaction

If you do not use transaction control statements in the calling
application, the transaction initiated by the CALL statement might not
automatically commit or roll back changes to the database. When
AUTOCOMMIT is ON (the default setting), the database engine
automatically commits or rolls back any changes made to the database at
the end of the CALL statement execution. However, when AUTOCOMMIT is
OFF, the current transaction remains active until the end of the client
session or until you explicitly commit or roll back the transaction.

To ensure an atomic unit of work when calling an SPJ, use the COMMIT
WORK statement in the calling application to commit the transaction when
the CALL statement succeeds, and use the ROLLBACK WORK statement to roll
back the transaction when the CALL statement fails. For more information
about transaction management, see the __Trafodion SQL Reference Manual__.

=== No Transaction Required

In some cases, you might not want the SPJ method to inherit the
transaction from the calling application. Instead, you might want the
stored procedure to manage its own transactions or to run without a
transaction. Not inheriting the calling application's transaction is
useful in these cases:

* The stored procedure performs several long-running operations, such as
multiple DDL or table maintenance operations, on the database. In this
case, you might want to commit those operations periodically from within
the SPJ method to avoid locking tables for a long time.
* The stored procedure performs certain SQL operations that must run
without an active transaction. For example, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
statements with the WITH NO ROLLBACK option are rejected when a
transaction is already active, as is the case when a stored procedure
inherits a transaction from the calling application. The PURGEDATA
utility is also rejected when a transaction is already active.
* The stored procedure does not access the database. (For an example,
see the link:#_bookmark250["TOTALPRICE] link:#_bookmark250[Procedure"
(page 73)].) In this case, the stored procedure does not need to inherit
the transaction from the calling application. By setting the stored
procedure's transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED, you can
avoid the overhead of the calling application's transaction being
propagated to the stored procedure.

In these cases, you should set the stored procedure's transaction
attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED when creating the stored procedure.
For more information, see the Transaction Required attribute in
link:#_bookmark116["Create a Procedure" (page 37)].

If you select No for the Transaction Required attribute when creating a
stored procedure and if the SPJ method creates a JDBC default
connection, that connection will have autocommit enabled by default. You
can either use the autocommit transactions or disable autocommit
(conn.setAutoCommit(false);) and use the JDBC transaction methods,
Connection.commit() and Connection.rollback(), to commit or roll back
work where needed.

== Multithreading

The Trafodion database engine manages a single thread of execution within
an SPJ environment, even if the application that issues a CALL statement
is a multithreaded Java application. The CALL statements in a
multithreaded application can execute in a nonblocking manner, but the
SPJ methods underlying those CALL statements execute serially within a
given SPJ environment.

== Using the CALL Statement

To invoke a stored procedure, specify the name of the stored procedure
and its arguments in a CALL statement, as shown in
link:#_bookmark167[Figure 2]:

image:media/image8.png[image]Figure 2 CALL Statement Elements

For the syntax of the CALL statement, see the __Trafodion SQL Reference
Manual__.

=== Specifying the Name of the SPJ

In the CALL statement, specify the name of an SPJ that you have already
created in the database. Qualify the procedure name with the same
catalog and schema that you specified when you registered the SPJ. For
example:

```
CALL demo.persnl.adjustsalary(202, 5.5, ?);
```

Or, for example:

```
SET SCHEMA demo.persnl;

CALL adjustsalary(202, 5.5, ?);
```

If you do not fully qualify the procedure name, the database engine
qualifies the procedure according to the catalog and schema of the
current session.

=== Listing the Parameter Arguments of the SPJ

Each argument that you list in the CALL statement must correspond to an
SQL parameter of the SPJ. A result set in the Java signature of the SPJ
method does not correspond to an SQL parameter. Do not specify result
sets in the argument list.

For example, if you registered the stored procedure with three SQL
parameters (two IN parameters and one OUT parameter), you must list
three formal parameter arguments, separated by commas, in the CALL
statement:

```
CALL demo.persnl.adjustsalary(202, 5, ?);
```

If the SPJ does not accept arguments, you must specify empty
parentheses, as shown below:

```
CALL demo.sales.lowerprice();
```

If the SPJ has one IN parameter, one OUT parameter, and two result sets,
you must list the IN and OUT parameters but not the result sets in the
argument list:

```
CALL demo.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2011', ?);
```

==== Data Conversion of Parameter Arguments

The database engine performs an implicit data conversion when the data
type of a parameter argument is compatible with but does not match the
formal data type of the stored procedure. For stored procedure input
values, the conversion is from the actual argument value to the formal
parameter type. For stored procedure output values, the conversion is
from the actual output value, which has the data type of the formal
parameter, to the declared type of the dynamic parameter.

==== Input Parameter Arguments

To pass data to an IN or INOUT parameter of an SPJ, specify an SQL value
expression that evaluates to a character, date-time, or numeric value.
The SQL value expression can evaluate to NULL provided that the
underlying Java parameter supports null values. For more information,
see link:#_bookmark58["Null Input and Output" (page 22)].

For an IN parameter argument, use one of these SQL value expressions in
link:#_bookmark175[Table 2]:

Table 2 Input Parameter Argument Types

Type of Argument Examples

Literal

CALL adjustsalary(**202**, 5.5, ?);

CALL dailyorders(**DATE '2011-03-19**', ?); CALL totalprice(23,
*'nextday'* , ?param);

SQL function (including CASE and CAST expressions)

CALL dailyorders(**CURRENT_DATE**, ?);

Arithmetic expression CALL adjustsalary(202, **?percent * 0.25**, :OUT
newsalary);

Concatenation operation

CALL totalprice(23, **'next' || 'day'**, ?param);

Scalar subquery

Dynamic parameter

CALL totalprice(**(SELECT qty_ordered**

*FROM odetail*

**WHERE ordernum = 100210 AND partnum = 5100)**,

'nextday', ?param);

CALL adjustsalary(**?**, ?, ?);

CALL adjustsalary(**?param1**, ?param2, ?param3);

For more information about SQL value expressions, see the __Trafodion SQL
Reference Manual__.

Because an INOUT parameter passes a single value to and accepts a single
value from an SPJ, you can specify only dynamic parameters for INOUT
parameter arguments in a CALL statement.

==== Output Parameter Arguments

Except for result sets, an SPJ returns values in OUT and INOUT
parameters. Each OUT or INOUT parameter accepts only one value from an
SPJ. Any attempt to return more than one value to an output parameter
results in a Java exception. See link:#_bookmark48["Returning Output
Values From the Java Method"] link:#_bookmark48[(page 19)].

OUT and INOUT parameter arguments must be dynamic parameters in a client
application (for example, ?) or named or unnamed parameters in trafci
(for example, ?param or ?).

For information about how to call SPJs in different applications, see:

* link:#_bookmark188["Calling SPJs in trafci" (page 53)]
* link:#_bookmark196["Calling SPJs From an ODBC Client Application"
(page 54)]
* link:#_bookmark200["Calling SPJs From a JDBC Client Application" (page
56)]

==== Result Sets

Result sets are an ordered set of open cursors that the SPJ method
returns to the calling application in java.sql.ResultSet[] parameter
arrays. The java.sql.ResultSet[] parameters do not correspond to SQL
parameters, so you must not include them in the parameter argument list
of a CALL statement.

The calling application can retrieve multiple rows of data from the
java.sql.ResultSet[]
parameters. For information about how to process result sets in
different applications, see:

* link:#_bookmark194["Returning Result Sets in trafci" (page 54)]
* link:#_bookmark198["Returning Result Sets in an ODBC Client
Application" (page 55)]
* link:#_bookmark204["Returning Result Sets in a JDBC Client
Application" (page 56)]

== Calling SPJs in trafci

In trafci, you can invoke an SPJ by issuing a CALL statement directly or
by preparing and executing a CALL statement.

Use named or unnamed parameters anywhere in the argument list of an SPJ
invoked in trafci. A named parameter is set by the SET PARAM command, and
an unnamed parameter is set by the USING clause of the EXECUTE
statement.

You must use a parameter for an OUT or INOUT parameter argument. trafci
displays all output parameter values and result sets after you issue the
CALL statement. The procedure call changes the value of a named
parameter that you use as an OUT or INOUT parameter.

For more information about named and unnamed parameters, see the _HP
Database Command_ __Interface (trafci) Guide__.

=== Using Named Parameters

In an trafci session, invoke the SPJ named TOTALPRICE, which has two IN
parameters and one INOUT parameter. This SPJ accepts the quantity,
shipping speed, and price of an item, calculates the total price,
including tax and shipping charges, and returns the total price. For
more information, see the link:#_bookmark250["TOTALPRICE Procedure"
(page 73)].

Set the input value for the INOUT parameter by entering a SET PARAM
command before calling the SPJ:

```
SQL>**set param ?p 10;**

SQL>**call demo.sales.totalprice(23, 'standard', ?p);**
```

The CALL statement returns the total price of the item:

```
p
--------------------
253.97

--- SQL operation complete.
```

The value of the named parameter, ?p, changes from 10 to the returned
value, 253.97:

```
SQL>**show param**

p 253.97
```

=== Using Unnamed Parameters

In an trafci session, invoke the SPJ named TOTALPRICE by preparing and
executing a CALL statement. The INOUT parameter accepts a value that is
set by the USING clause of the EXECUTE statement and returns the total
price:

```
SQL>**prepare stmt1 from call demo.sales.totalprice(50, 'nextday',?);**

--- SQL command prepared.

SQL>**execute stmt1 using 2.25;**
```

The output of the prepared CALL statement is:

```
PRICE
--------------------
136.77

--- SQL operation complete.
```

In an trafci session, invoke the SPJ named TOTALPRICE again by preparing
and executing a CALL statement in which all three parameters accept
values that are set by the USING clause of the EXECUTE statement. The
INOUT parameter returns the total price:

```
SQL>**prepare stmt2 from call demo.sales.totalprice(?,?,?);**

--- SQL command prepared.

SQL>**execute stmt2 using 3, 'economy', 16.99;**
```

The output of the prepared CALL statement is:

```
PRICE
--------------------

57.13

--- SQL operation complete.
```

=== Returning Result Sets in trafci

If a CALL statement returns result sets, trafci displays column headings
and data for each returned result set in the same format as SELECT
statements. For example, this CALL statement returns an output parameter
for the number of orders and two result sets in the trafci session:

```
SQL>**call demo.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2011', ?);**

NUM_ORDERS
--------------------
13

ORDERNUM NUM_PARTS            AMOUNT               ORDER_DATE LAST_NAME 
-------- -------------------- -------------------- ---------- --------------------
HUGHES HUGHES SCHNABL

...

--- 13 row(s) selected.

ORDERNUM PARTNUM UNIT_PRICE QTY_ORDERED PARTDESC

-------- ------- ---------- ----------- ------------------ 100210 244
3500.00 3 PC GOLD, 30 MB

100210 2001 1100.00 3 GRAPHIC PRINTER,M1

100210 2403 620.00 6 DAISY PRINTER,T2

... ... ... ... ...

--- 70 row(s) selected.

--- SQL operation complete.
```

For other result set examples, see link:#_bookmark221[Appendix A (page
62)].

== Calling SPJs From an ODBC Client Application

You can execute a CALL statement in an ODBC client application.
Microsoft ODBC requires that you put the CALL statement in an escape
clause:

```
{call _procedure-name_ ([__parameter__][,[__parameter__]]...)}
```

For IN or INOUT parameters, use a literal or a parameter marker (?). You
cannot use an empty string as an IN or INOUT parameter in the argument
list. If you specify a literal for an INOUT parameter, the driver
discards the output value.

For OUT parameters, you can use only a parameter marker (?). You must
bind all parameter markers with the SQLBindParameter function before you
can execute the CALL statement.

In this example, a CALL statement is executed from an ODBC client
application:

```
/* Declare variables. */
SQLHSTMT hstmt; SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT salary; SDWORD cbParam = SQL_NTS;

/* Bind the parameter markers. */

SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_NUMERIC, SQL_NUMERIC, 4, 0, 202, 0, &cbParam);

SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 2, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_FLOAT, SQL_FLOAT, 0, 0, 5.5, 0, &cbParam);

SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 3, SQL_PARAM_OUTPUT, SQL_C_NUMERIC, SQL_NUMERIC, 8, 2, &salary, 0, &cbParam);

/* Execute the CALL statement. */

SQLExecDirect(hstmt, "{call demo.persnl.adjustsalary(?,?,?)}", SQL_NTS);
```

For more information about ODBC client applications, see the __Neoview
ODBC Drivers Manual__.

=== Returning Result Sets in an ODBC Client Application

This example shows how an ODBC client application processes the result
sets returned by a CALL statement. The SQLMoreResults() function closes
the current result set and moves processing to the next available result
set.

NOTE: The HP ODBC API does not currently support interleaved result set
processing, where more than one returned result set can be open at a
time.

```
/* Allocate a statement handle */
SQLHSTMT s;

RETCODE rc = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, myConnection, &s);

/* Prepare a CALL */
char *stmtText = "{call demo.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2011', ?)}";
rc = SQLPrepare(s, (SQLCHAR *) stmtText, strlen(stmtText));

/* Bind the output parameter */
_int64 num_orders = 0; SQLINTEGER indicator;

rc = SQLBindParameter(s, 2, SQL_PARAM_OUTPUT, SQL_C_SBIGINT, SQL_BIGINT, 0, 0, &num_orders, 0, &indicator);

/* Execute the CALL */
rc = SQLExecute(s);

/* Process all returned result sets. The outer while loop repeats */

/* until there are no more result sets. */
while ((rc = SQLMoreResults(s)) != SQL_NO_DATA)
{
  /* The inner while loop processes each row of the current result set */
  while (SQL_SUCCEEDED(rc = SQLFetch(hStmt)))
  {
    /* Process the row */
  }
}

== Calling SPJs From a JDBC Client Application

You can execute a CALL statement in a JDBC client application by using
the JDBC CallableStatement interface. The HP JDBC Type 4 driver requires
that you put the CALL statement in an escape clause:

```
{call _procedure-name_ ([__parameter__[{, __parameter__}...]])}
```

Set input values for IN and INOUT parameters by using the set__type__()
methods of the CallableStatement interface.

Retrieve output values from OUT and INOUT parameters by using the
get__type__() methods of the CallableStatement interface.

If the parameter mode is OUT or INOUT, you must register the parameter
as an output parameter by using the registerOutParameter() method of the
CallableStatement interface before executing the CALL statement.

In this example, a CALL statement is executed from a JDBC client application:

```
CallableStatement stmt =

con.prepareCall("{call demo.persnl.adjustsalary(?,?,?)}");

stmt.setBigDecimal(1,202); // x = 202 stmt.setDouble(2,5.5); // y = 5.5
stmt.registerOutParameter(3, java.sql.Types.NUMERIC);

stmt.execute();

BigDecimal z = stmt.getBigDecimal(3); // Retrieve the value of the
// OUT parameter
```
For more information about the HP JDBC Type 4 driver and mappings of SQL
to JDBC data types, see the __Neoview JDBC Type 4 Driver Programmer's
Reference__.

=== Returning Result Sets in a JDBC Client Application

This example shows serial result set processing in a JDBC client
application where the result sets are processed in order and one at a
time after the CALL statement executes. The
java.sql.Statement.getMoreResults() method closes the current result set
and moves processing to the next available result set.

```
// Prepare a CALL statement

java.sql.CallableStatement s = myConnection.prepareCall ( "{call
demo.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2011', ?)}" );

// Register an output parameter s.registerOutParameter(1,
java.sql.Types.BIGINT);

// Execute the CALL

boolean rsAvailable = s.execute();

// Process all returned result sets. The outer while loop continues

// until there are no more result sets. while (rsAvailable)

{

// The inner while loop processes each row of the current result set
java.sql.ResultSet rs = s.getResultSet();

while (rs.next())

{

// Process the row

}

rsAvailable = s.getMoreResults();

}
```

This example shows how a JDBC client application can have more than one
stored procedure result set open at a given time. The
`java.sql.Statement.getMoreResults(int)` method
uses its input argument to decide whether currently open result sets
should remain open or be closed before the next result set is made
available.

```
// Prepare a CALL statement

java.sql.CallableStatement s = myConnection.prepareCall ( "{call
demo.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2011', ?)}" );

// Register an output parameter s.registerOutParameter(1,
java.sql.Types.BIGINT);

// Execute the CALL s.execute();

// Open the FIRST result set java.sql.ResultSet firstRS =
s.getResultSet();

// Open the SECOND result set but do not close the FIRST
s.getMoreResults(java.sql.Statement.KEEP_CURRENT_RESULT);
java.sql.ResultSet secondRS = s.getResultSet();

// The outer loop processes each row of the FIRST result set while
(firstRS.next())

{

// Process a row from the FIRST result set
// The inner loop processes some number of rows from the SECOND
// result set. The number depends on data extracted from the
// current row of the FIRST result set.

for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ROWS_TO_PROCESS; i++)

{

// Process a row from the SECOND result set secondRS.next();

}

}
```

== Calling an SPJ in a Trigger

A trigger is a mechanism in the database that enables the database
engine to perform certain actions when a specified event occurs. SPJs
are useful as triggered actions because they can help you encapsulate
and enforce rules in the database. For more information about the
benefits of using SPJs, see link:#_bookmark11["Benefits of SPJs" (page
11)].

Trafodion SQL supports a CALL statement in a trigger provided that the
SPJ in the CALL statement does not have any OUT or INOUT parameters or
return any result sets. For more information, see
link:#_bookmark48["Returning Output Values From the Java Method" (page
19)], link:#_bookmark183["Output Parameter Arguments"]
link:#_bookmark183[(page 52)], or link:#_bookmark54["Returning Stored
Procedure Result Sets" (page 20)].

This example creates a trigger that executes an SPJ named LOWERPRICE
when the QTY_ON_HAND column of the PARTLOC table is updated and exceeds
500 parts:

```
CREATE TRIGGER demo.sales.setsalesprice AFTER UPDATE OF qty_on_hand
ON demo.invent.partloc FOR EACH STATEMENT
REFERENCING NEW as newqty
WHEN ( SUM(newqty.qty_on_hand) > 500 ) CALL demo.sales.lowerprice();
```

For information about the CREATE TRIGGER syntax, see the __Trafodion SQL
Reference Manual__.
