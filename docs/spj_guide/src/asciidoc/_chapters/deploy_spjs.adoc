[[Deploy-spj-jar-files]]
= Deploy SPJ JAR Files

After developing and packaging the SPJ code into JAR files, you must
move the JAR files from the client workstation to the Trafodion database.

You can upload a SPJ JAR file and create a library by using
the ADD LIBRARY command in the Trafodion Command Interface (trafci).
You use the CREATE LIBRARY, ALTER LIBRARY, and DROP LIBRARY commands.

Libraries provide greater security for JAR files because libraries are
database objects whose access is controlled using standard SQL security.

Deploying a JAR file to a Trafodion instance requires creating a library,
and users must have the required privileges for creating libraries in order
to deploy JAR files.

See these instructions:

* <<create-a-library, Create a Library>>
* <alter-a-library, Alter a Library>>
* <<drop-a-library, Drop a Library>>
* <<download-a-jar-file-from-a-library, Download a JAR File From a Library>>
* <<display-libraries-and-their-properties, Display Libraries and Their Properties>>

Before you start, see
<<required-privileges-for-creating-altering-or-dropping-a-library, "Required Privileges for Creating, Altering, or Dropping a Library">>.


== Required Privileges for Creating, Altering, or Dropping a Library

Deploying a JAR file to the Trafodion database requires creating a
library, and you must have the required privileges for creating
libraries in order to deploy a JAR file. To create a library in a
schema, you must have both the CREATE_LIBRARY component privilege and
the CREATE_LIBRARY schema-level privilege for the schema. For more
information, see the requirements in <create-a-library, Create a Library>>.

To alter a library in a schema, you must have both the UPDATE privilege
for the library and the ALTER_LIBRARY privilege for the schema. For more
information, see the requirements in
<<alter-a-library, Alter a Library>>.

To drop a library from a schema, you must have the DROP_LIBRARY
privilege for the schema. For more information, see the requirements in
<<drop-a-library, Drop a Library>>.

To download a JAR file from a library, you must have the CREATE_LIBRARY
component privilege. For more information, see the requirements in
<<download-a-jar-file-from-a-library, Download a JAR File From a Library>>.

[[create-a-library]]
== Create a Library

Refer to the
http://trafodion.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html[Trafodion SQL Reference Manual]
for full documentation of the
http://trafodion.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html#create_library_statement[CREATE LIBRARY]
statement.

When you create a library, HPDM simultaneously uploads an SPJ JAR file
from the client workstation to the Trafodion database and creates a
library for the JAR file in a schema of the database.

Requirements:

* You must have the CREATE_LIBRARY privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS
component. For more information, see the component privileges in the _HP
Database Manager (HPDM) User Guide_ or the online help in HPDM.
* You must either be the owner of the schema where you will create the
library or have the CREATE_LIBRARY privilege for the schema to create
the library. The schema owner can grant such a schema-level privilege to
other users or roles. For more information, see the

Grant/Revoke Privileges Tool in HPDM or the GRANT SCHEMA statement in
the __Trafodion SQL Reference Manual__.

* The JAR file that you select for the library must contain valid Java
bytecode and must not be used by another library in the catalog.
* The JAR file that you select for the library must not exceed a size
threshold if one has been set for HPDM's internal WMS service, the data
source, or the system defaults.

For example, if the CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT (CQD),
POS_ABSOLUTE_MAX_TABLE_SIZE,

has been set for the HPS_MANAGEABILITY service, it will limit the size
of JAR files that can be uploaded by HPDM. If the JAR file's size
exceeds the threshold, a warning message is displayed, and the file is
not uploaded. By default, this CQD is not set for HPDM's internal WMS
service, the data source, or the system defaults, and HPDM allows you to
upload JAR files of any size.

To upload a JAR file and create a library for the JAR file in a schema:

1.  In HPDM, select the Database area.
2.  In the navigation tree pane, expand the tree to display the folders
of the schema where you want to create the library.
3.  Right-click the Libraries folder, and select Create Library. The
Create Library dialog box appears. For more information, see
link:#_bookmark98["Use the Create Library Dialog Box" (page 31)].
4.  In the Create Library dialog box, enter a name for the library.

The name must be unique among the libraries in the schema and must not
exceed 128 characters. The library name is not case-sensitive. For
example, if you enter Payroll as the library name, the database engine
stores the library as

__catalog-name__.__schema-name__.PAYROLL. The database engine
automatically qualifies the library name with the name of the catalog
and schema in which you are creating the library.

1.  Click the [ Browse ] button to locate and select a JAR file on the
client workstation. The "Select a code file" dialog box appears.
2.  In the "Select a code file" dialog box, locate and select the JAR
file on the client workstation, and click [ Open ] to return to the
Create Library dialog box. The Create Library dialog box displays the
full path of the JAR file in the Code File field.
3.  Click [ Create ] to create the library, or click [ Close ] to quit
the dialog box without creating the library.

If you click [ Create ], HPDM validates the JAR file, uploads the JAR
file, and creates a library for the JAR file in the schema.

1.  When notified that the library was created successfully, click [ OK
].
2.  To upload another JAR file and create a library, repeat steps 4
through 8.
3.  When you are done uploading JAR files and creating libraries, click
the [ Close ] button image:media/image4.png[image]) to quit the Create
Library dialog box and return to the HPDM main window.
