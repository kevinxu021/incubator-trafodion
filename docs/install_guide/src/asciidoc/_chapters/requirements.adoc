= Requirements

The current release of Trafodion has been tested with:

* 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7
* SUSE SLES 11.3
* Cloudera CDH 5.2
* Cloudera CDH 5.3
* Hortonworks HDP 2.2

Other OS releases may work, too. The Trafodion project is currently working on better support for non-distribution version of Hadoop.

== General Hardware and OS Requirements and Recommendations

Trafodion assumes an environment based on the requirements of the supported Hadoop distributions. Please verify these assumptions on 
each server you will install Trafodion on:

* `bash` is available for shell-script execution.
* `sshd` (the `ssh` daemon) is running on each node in the cluster.
* `ntpd` (the `ntp` daemon) is running and synchronizign time on each node in the cluster.
* `/etc/hosts` is set up for fully-qualified node names (FQDN).
* `/etc/resolv.conf` is configured to use a name server tat can resolve commands such as `host -T <FQDN>`. 
Please attempt to use such a command to validate host-name resolution.
* The Linux Kernel Firewall (`iptables`) has either been disabled (to check: `service iptables status` (requires sudo access) 
or <<ip_ports,ports required by Trafodion>> have been opened

[[ip_ports]]
=== IP Ports
The following table lists the default ports used by the different Trafodion components plus the configuration file and configuration attribute associated with each port setting.

|===

There are two port ranges used by Trafodion.

* 23400 is a range, to allow multiple mxosrvr processes on each node. Allow a range of a few ports,
enough to cover all the servers per node that are listed in the "servers" file in the DCS configuration directory.
* 24410 is a range as well, enough to cover the DCS servers per node, usually 1 or 2.

On top of the ports identified above, you also need the ports required by your Hadoop distribution. For example:

* http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_ig_ports_cdh5.html[_Cloudera Ports_]
* http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.0-Win/bk_HDP_Install_Win/content/ref-79239257-778e-42a9-9059-d982d0c08885.1.html[_Hortonworks Ports_]

Although not all the ports will be used on every node of the cluster, you need to open most of them for all the nodes in the cluster that
have Trafodion, HBase, or HDFS servers on them.
