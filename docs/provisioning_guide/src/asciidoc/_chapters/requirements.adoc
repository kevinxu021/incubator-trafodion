= Requirements

Trafodion requires an x86 version of Linux. 

The current release of Trafodion has been tested with:

* 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7
* SUSE SLES 11.3
* Cloudera CDH 5.2
* Cloudera CDH 5.3
* Hortonworks HDP 2.2

Other OS releases may work, too. The Trafodion project is currently working on better support for non-distribution version of Hadoop.

[[general-cluster-and-os-requirements-and-recommendations]]
== General Cluster and OS Requirements and Recommendations

64-bit x86 instruction set running a Linux distribution is required. Further, Trafodion assumes an environment 
based on the requirements of the supported Hadoop distributions. 

[[cluster-requirements-and-recommendations]]
=== Hardware Requirements and Recommendations

==== Single-Node Cluster
It is possible to run Trafodion on a single-node sandbox environment. Typically, any sandbox running a Hadoop distribution 
can be used. A typical single-node configuration uses 4-8 cores with 16 GB of memory, and  20 GB free disk space beyond 
what's used for the Hadoop environment.

==== Multi-Node Cluster 
For multi-node end-user clusters, your typical HBase environment should suffice for Trafodion.
Typically, memory configuration range between 64-128 GB per node with minimum requirement of 16 GB. 
The cluster size can span from 1 to _n_ nodes; a minimum of two nodes is recommended. 
A minumum of two cores is required regardless of whether you're deploying Trafodion on a bare-metal or virtual environment. 

Recommended configurations:

[cols="40%h,60%a"]
|===
| Processors per Node |
* Small: 2 cores
* Medium: 4 cores
* Large: 8+ cores
| Memory per Node |
* Small: 16 GB
* Medium: 64 GB
* Large: 128 GB
| Concurrency:Nodes |
* Two Small Nodes: Four concurrent queries
* Two Medium Nodes: 64 concurrent queries
* Two Large Nodes: 256 concurrent queries

|===

There are two port ranges used by Trafodion.

* 23400 is a range, to allow multiple mxosrvr processes on each node. Allow a range of a few ports,
enough to cover all the servers per node that are listed in the "servers" file in the DCS configuration directory.
* 24410 is a range as well, enough to cover the DCS servers per node, usually 1 or 2.

On top of the ports identified above, you also need the ports required by your Hadoop distribution. For example:

* http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_ig_ports_cdh5.html[_Cloudera Ports_]
* http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.0-Win/bk_HDP_Install_Win/content/ref-79239257-778e-42a9-9059-d982d0c08885.1.html[_Hortonworks Ports_]

Although not all the ports will be used on every node of the cluster, you need to open most of them for all the nodes in the cluster that
have Trafodion, HBase, or HDFS servers on them.

== Prerequisite Software

Trafodion runs as an add-on service on Hadoop distributions. The following Hadoop services and their dependiencies must be installed and running 
on the cluster where you intend to install Trafodion:

* Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
* YARN with MapReduce version 2
* ZooKeeper
* HBase
* Hive
* Apache Ambari (Hortonworks) or Cloudera Manager (Cloudera) with associated embedded databases.

The following distributions are supported for Trafodion:

[cols="25%,15%,10%,50%",options="header"]
|===
| Distribution                                        | Version        | HBase Version | Installation Documentation

|===

^1^ When possible, install using *parcels* to simply the installation process.

NOTE: Trafodion does not yet support installation on a non-distribution version of Hadoop; that is,
Hadoop downloaded from the Apache web site. This restriction will be lifted in a later release of
Trafodion.

=== Software Packages

In addition to the software packages required to run different Hadoop services listed above (for example, `Java`), 
the following software packages and their dependencies must be installed on all nodes where Trafodion will be installed.

NOTE: For RedHat/CentOS, the Trafodion Installer can install a subset of the packages below.

|===

1. `log4c&#43;&#43;` was recently withdrawn from public repositories. Therefore, you will need to build the `log4c&#43;&#43;` RPM
on your system and then install the RPM using the procedure described in <<log4cplusplus_installation,log4c++ Installation>>.
2. Software package required to build `log4c&#43;&#43;`. Not required otherwise. These packages are *not* installed by the Trafodon Installer in this release.

The Trafodion Installer requires Internet access to install the required software packages.

== Trafodion User IDs and Their Priviliges

=== Runtime

The `trafodion:trafodion` user ID is created as part of the installation process. The default password is: `traf123`.

Trafodion runs under this ID, which must be registered as a user in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to store and 
access objects in HDFS, HBase, and Hive.  In addition, the `trafodion` user ID required passwordless access among the nodes 
where Trafodion is installed.

Trafodion requires that either HDFS ACLs or Kerberos is enabled.

Trafodion users are managed by the Trafodion security features (grant, revoke, etc.), which can be integrated with LDAP if so desired. 
These users are referred to as *database users* and do not have direct access to the operating system.

NOTE: Do *not* create the `trafodion:trafodion` user ID in advance. The Trafodion Installer uses the presence of this user ID to determine
whether you're doing an installation or upgrade.

=== Installation/Upgrades

Typically, the Trafodion Installer is used for Trafodion installations. It requires access to the following user IDs:

[cols="20%a,30%a,50%a",options="header"]
|===
| User ID              | Usage           | Requirements
| Linux                | Run the Trafodion Installer, which sets up the enviroment and installs the Trafodion software.  | 
* User name or group cannot be `trafodion`.
* Passwordless ssh access to all nodes in the cluster.
* Internet access to download software packages.
* `requiretty` must be disabled in `/etc/sudoers`.
* `sudo`^1^ access to:
** Download and install software packages.
** Mofify `/etc/sudoers.d` (allow the `trafodion` user to modify floating IP: `ip` and `arping`).
** Create the `trafodion` user ID and group.
** Install Trafodion software into the HBase environment.
** Run Java version command on each node in the cluster.
** Run Hadoop version command on each node in the cluster.
** Run HBase version command on each node in the cluster.
** Create directories and files in:
*** `/etc`
*** `/usr/lib`
*** `/var/log`
** Invoke `su` to execute commands as other users; for example, `trafodion`.
** Edit `sysctl.conf` and activate changes using `sysctl -p`:
*** Modify kernel limits.
*** Reserve IP ports.

^1^ `sudo` is *required* in the current release of Trafodion. This restriction may be relaxed in later releases.
Alternative mechanisms for priviliged access (such as running as `root` or `sudo` alternative commands) are not supported.
| Distribution Manager | Modify configuration and stop/start services. | 
* Administrator user name and password.
* URL to Distribution Manager's REST API.
| HDFS Administator | Create directories and change security setting, if needed. | 
* HDFS Administrator user name and password.
* Write access to home directory on the node where the Distribution Manager is running.
| HBase Administator | | 
* HBase Administrator user name and password.
* Read access to `hbase-site.xml`.

=== Recommended HBase Configuration Changes

[cols="30%l,20%,50%a",options="header"]
|===
| Configuration Property | Recommended Setting | Guidance
| hbase.rpc.timeout | 10 minutes | This setting depends on the tables' size. Sixty (60) seconds is the default. 
Increase this value for big tables. Make it the same value as `hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period`. We have found 
that increasing the setting to six-hundred (600) seconds will prevent many of the timeout-related errors we encountered, 
such as `OutOfOrderNextException` errors.
| hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period | 10 minutes | Similar to the `hbase.rpc.timeout` setting. Sixty (60) seconds is the 
default. Depending on the size of a user table, we have experienced timeout failures on count(\*) and update statistics commands 
from this setting. The underlying issue is the length of the execution of the coprocessor within HBase.

NOTE: HBase uses the smaller of `hbase.rpc.timeout` and `hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period` to calculate the scanner timeout. 
| hbase.snapshot.master.timeoutMillis and hbase.snapshot.region.timeout | 10 minutes | HBase's default setting is 60000 milliseconds. 
If you experience timeout issues with HBase snapshots when you use the Trafodion Bulk Loader or other statements, 
you can set the value for these two HBase properties to 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds).
| hbase.hregion.max.filesize | 107374182400 bytes | HBase's default setting is 10737418240 (10 GB). We have increased the setting to 
107374182400 (100 GB), which reduces the number of HStoreFiles per table and appears to reduce disruptions to active transactions from 
region splitting.
| hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles | 10 | http://gbif.blogspot.com/2012/07/optimizing-writes-in-hbase.html
| hbase.regionserver.handler.count | <num> | This setting should match the number of concurrent sessions (mxosrvr). The default is 10.
