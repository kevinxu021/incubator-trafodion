The EsgynDB Manager is a web application that monitors and manages an EsgynDB instance. The architecture is very flexible and lightweight.

* DB Manager runs as an embedded jetty webserver. No additional packages to install.
* Communication with EsgynDB core is through JDBC and HTTP requests. 
* Webserver code is 100% Java.
* The web client layer uses HTML5/JavaScript/CSS.
* Client to DB Manager webserver communication uses HTTPS encryption.
* Uses JDBC Authentication.
* EsgynDB Manager has been tested with Chrome, IE11, Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers.
* When you connect up to an Enterprise Edition of EsgynDB, you get additional managaeability components that use OpenTSDB, TCollector and Bosun
