The tools menu provides a list of generic tools to manage or make changes to EsgynDB.
In the current release, we support a create library tool to ease the deployment of library code files.

=== Create Library Tool
The create library tool is made easily accessible through the Tools menu without having to navigate through the database library pages.

See <<Create Library, Create Library>> for details.
