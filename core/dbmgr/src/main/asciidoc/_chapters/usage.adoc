== Using EsgynDB Manager
:doctype: book

This chapter describes how to connect to EsgynDB Manager and use its features.

=== Connecting to EsgynDB Manager

Open a web browser and point to the host name on which EsgynDB Manager is running. You can use either the HTTP port or the HTTPS port number set in the EsgynDB Manager configuration file. If you use the HTTP port, the request is automatically redirected to the HTTPS port.

----
http://my.esgyndb.server:4205
----

Or

----
https://my.esgyndb.server:4206
----
=== Login
In the Login page, a valid EsgynDB database user name and password and click on the Login button. EsgynDB Manager relies on database authentication and makes a JDBC connection to authenticate the user.

=== Navigation
To Navigate the UI and access the different features, use the navigation menus at the top of the screen.

=== Notifications Panel

In the top-right corner of the page, you will see a bell icon and whenever there is an asynchronous  notification, you'll see a yellow exclamation mark on it indicating there is a new notification. When you click on the bell icon, you'll be shown a list of notifications with details.

The notifications panel is used to notify that an asynchronous operation is complete and the results are available. The results are added to the notifications panel, only if you have navigated away from the page where the operation was initiated.

For example: In the Create Library page, you initiate a create library operation and if you stay in that page until the operation completes, then the result is displayed in a message window in the same page. But if you navigate away from the create library page before the operation is complete, then the success or failure message is added to the notification panel.

You can click on the notifications panel anytime to view the results. Clicking on the x mark on the notification message will remove the message from the notification panel.

These asynchronous notifications are available for the following functions:

* Create Library
* Alter Library
* Execute or Explain operations in Query Workbench
* Cancel Query from the workload pages

=== EsgynDB Manager User Guide
You can access an online version of this user guide using the *Help +++->+++ User Guide* navigation menu.

=== About
Use the *Help +++->+++ About* navigation menu to view the version of DB Manager. The page also displays the version of the EsgynDB instance you are currently connected to. When you contact Esgyn for DB Manager technical support, provide the information in the About page.

=== Log Out
You can click on the user icon at the top right corner of the application and select the *Logout* option.

=== EsgynDB Time-Series Metrics
EsgynDB leverages the tcollector infrastructure and publishes the following metrics as time series data points into OpenTSDB.

These metrics can then be queried and graphed as time series charts or used in alert rule templates for notifications.

|esgyndb.dtm.configure | Number of DTM processes that are down
|esgyndb.dtm.running | Number of DTM processes that are up
|esgyndb.dtm.down | Number of DTM processes that are down
|esgyndb.dtm.txnaborts | Number of transaction aborts. This is a cumulative counter since the last sqstart. The delta can be computed in the TSD query.
|esgyndb.dtm.txnbegins | Number of transaction begins. This is a cumulative counter since the last sqstart. The delta can be computed in the TSD query.
