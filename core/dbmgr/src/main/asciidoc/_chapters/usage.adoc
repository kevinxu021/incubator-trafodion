=== Dashboard

The dashboard page displays the status of the EsgynDB services, nodes and display time-series charts for key system and HBase metrics.

==== Service Status

The service status displays the status of the core EsgynDB services : *Transaction Manager, Connectivity Service and Runtime Manageability Service*.

For each service, you can see the number of configured processes, the number of actual running processes, the number of down processes if any.

- The status icon is green if all configured servers are up.
- The status icon is Yellow (Warning) if the number of actual servers is not equal to the configured servers.
- The status icon is RED (Error) if actual server count is 0 or if the actual servers are < 30% of the configured servers.

A tooltip on the status icon displays down process information if there are any. You can also export the data to a spreadsheet or clipboard.

The service status information is provided by the EsgynDB REST Server which invokes the trafcheck script.

==== Node Status

The node status reports if EsgynDB is *Up* or *Down* on the logical nodes configured in the EsgynDB cluster.
This information is provided by the EsgynDB REST Server which invokes the trafnodestatus script.

==== Transaction Counts
A time series chart to show the number of EsgynDB transaction begins, commits and aborts across all nodes.

The chart uses the OpenTSDB metrics *esgyndb.dtm.txnaborts*, *esgyndb.dtm.txnbegins*, *esgyndb.dtm.txncommits*.

These metrics are collected and published every 5 minutes.

==== Canary Response
The response times from an EsgynDB database canary check. The metrics displayed are the time taken to open a JDBC connection, time take to perform DDL operations (drop and create canary table), time take to write (insert 9 rows) and time taken to read (select) from the canary table.

The chart uses the OpenTSDB metrics *esgyndb.canary.sqlconnect.time*, *esgyndb.canary.sqlddl.time*, *esgyndb.canary.sqlwrite.time* and *esgyndb.canary.sqlread.time*.

These metrics are collected and published every 5 minutes.

==== IO Waits
The average IO Wait time percentage across all nodes.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *proc.stat.cpu{type=iowait}*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the IO Wait time for each node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

==== Disk Space Used %
The average disk space used percentage across all nodes.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *df.bytes.percentused*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the disk usage % for each node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

==== GC Time
The average JVM garbage collection time in milliseconds.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *hbase.regionserver.jvmmetrics.GcTimeMillis*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the average GC time for each node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

==== Regionserver Memory Use
The average memory (MB) used by the regionservers.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *hbase.regionserver.jvmmetrics.MemHeapUsedM*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the average memory used by each regionserver/node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

==== Memstore Size
The total memstore size (MB) of the different regions in the cluster.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *hbase.regionserver.regions.memStoreSize*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the total memstore file size in each node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

==== CPU Load
The average CPU Load average across all nodes.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *proc.loadavg.15min*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the average CPU load on each node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

==== Network IO
The average network IO (In/Out) measured in MB.

The chart uses OpenTSDB metric *proc.net.bytes*.

Click on the zoom-in icon to open a drill-down page and view the average network IO on each node. Each line in the drill-down graph represents a node.

=== Workloads
The Workload pages display EsgynDB query details. This includes all EsgynDB queries including user and system queries.

==== Active Workloads
The active workloads page displays the list of active EsgynDB queries. This includes queries that are currently executing and queries that completed within the last 30 seconds. The information is obtained from the EsgynDB Runtime Manageability Service.

The list of queries are displayed as a tabular output with the following information:

*Time*::
The time when the information was fetched
*Last Activity Seconds*::
A positive number shows how long the query has been active and is still executing. A negative number shows how long since the query completed execution. Queries remain in RMS memory for 30 seconds after completion.
*Query ID*::
The unique identifier for the query.
*Execution State*::
The current state of the query. Valid values are OPEN, EXECUTING, DEALLOCATED or COMPLETED.
*Query Text*::
The SQL statement of the query.

You can click on the Query ID hyper-link to drill-down into the details of that specific query.

Use the *Action +++->+++ Refresh* menu to refresh the list of active queries.

==== Active Query Details
The active query details page displays a summary of the runtime metrics as well the operator level statistics for the selected query. The metrics are obtained from the EsgynDB Runtime Manageability Service.

The metrics that have changed since the last refresh for this query, are highlighted in blue color, so you can observe how the query is progressing. For example if the operator CPU time is increasing, you know the operator and the query is progressing. If the CPU time for the operator does not increase, it indicates that operator is waiting for some other resource.

The page is set to auto-refresh every 30 seconds by default. You can also use the *Action +++->+++ Refresh* menu to refresh the page and reload the latest metrics for the query.

Click on the *Explain* button to view the explain plan for this query.

Use the *Action +++->+++ Cancel* menu to cancel the executing query.

==== Historical Workloads
You can use the historical workloads page to view queries that have run for longer than configured threshold (default 60 seconds).

The threshold is defined by the *dcs.server.user.program.statistics.limit.time* property in dcs-site.xml. If this property is not explicitly set, then the default value of 60 seconds apply.

Queries that exceed this run threshold are recorded in the EsgynDB manageability repository tables in the "\_REPOS_" schema. The historical workloads page fetches the query summary from the *"\_REPOS_".METRIC_QUERY_TABLE*.

By default the page displays the queries that either started or completed in the last 1 hour or is still executing. You can use the *Filters* option to change your search parameters. In the filter dialog, you can specify different time range or use additional filters like specific application names or user names or queries that match a particular query text. All the filter predicates are applied using *AND* operator, meaning that only queries that match all the filter predicates are returned.

Use the *Action +++->+++ Refresh* action option to refresh the page.

You can click on the Query ID hyper-link to drill-down into the details of a particular query.

==== Historical Query Detail
The historical query details page displays the details for the selected query. The details are grouped together as summary, query text, connection metrics, compile time metrics and run time metrics. The compile metrics includes estimates from the compiler. The runtime metrics are the actuals reported by the Runtime Manageability Service. You can compare the compile time metrics to the run time metrics and analyze the query behavior.

Click on the *Explain* button to view the explain plan for this query.

Use the *Action +++->+++ Cancel* menu to cancel the query, if the query is a long running query and is still executing.

==== Query Plan
The Query Plan page displays the Query ID, the query text, a visual explain plan and a textual explain plan.

For a query that is currently active, the textual plan may not show initially. If the query ran longer than a minute, then the textual plan is obtained from the repository and displayed.

Use the *Action +++->+++ Refresh* menu to refresh the page and reload the visual and textual plans.

If you click on a specific node in the explain tree, you will see the metrics for that specific operator in a pop-up dialog.

You can use the *Action +++->+++ Cancel* menu to cancel the query if the query is still executing.

==== Cancel Query
You can invoke the cancel action from the Active Workload Detail, Historical Workload Detail and Query Plan pages.

If the query is in EXECUTING state, a cancel request will be submitted to EsgynDB engine. If the user has the necessary SQL privileges to cancel the query, the engine would schedule a cancel of the query.

=== Logs
The Logs page displays the log and event messages from the EsgynDB processes. The logs are fetched using the logs Table Mapping Function which scans and filters the log entries from all the EsgynDB log files and provides a single consolidated time sequenced view.

The Log details include the following:

*Time*::
The time when the log event occurred
*Severity*::
The event severity (FATAL/ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG)
*Component*::
The EsgynDB component name reporting the event
