=== Troubleshooting
Use these common tips to troubleshoot any display issues with EsgynDB Manager.

* Cannot login to DB Manager
** Check the browser URL for accuracy. Make sure you have the right host name and port number.
** Verify that the DB Manager ports (4205/4206) are not blocked by any firewall.
** Check if DB Manager is running. Use the *mgblty_check* or *dbmgr.sh status* to confirm EsgynDB Manager is running.
** If DB Manager is up, verify that DCS, REST and EsgynDB is up and running.
*** trafcheck
*** dcscheck
*** restcheck

* Page is blank or partially loaded
** It could be a transient error like browser load timeouts. Log out and log back in.
** Sometimes refreshing the browser cache also helps.
** Check the browser console for errors.

* The Datetime values do not look right
** DB Manager displays all datetime values in the server's local time zone
** Make sure the timeZoneName property in the DB Manager config.xml matches the EsgynDB server time zone
** Make sure the timezoneName is specified the correct canonical form like America/Los_Angeles or Asia/Shanghai or Etc/UTC etc.

*Note:* You will need to restart DB Manager anytime you change property values in config.xml
