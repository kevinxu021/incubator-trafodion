    representations or warranties with respect to the Licensed Software or any
    portion thereof, and that Licensor and each Contributor assume no liability
    for any claim that may arise with respect to the Licensed Software or
    Customer’s use or inability to use the Licensed Software.  

9.  EXPORT CONTROL & CRYPTOGRAPHIC SOFTWARE NOTICE.  You shall not export or
    re-export any Licensed Software or portion thereof in any way outside the
    country where it was originally delivered, or otherwise use any Licensed
    Software in violation of any state or federal laws or regulations, including
    but not limited to the United States export control laws or regulations. 
    No Licensed Software may be sent to or used within any country designated by
    the United States Government as an embargoed or export-restricted country. 
    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Licensed Software
    includes cryptographic software.  The country in which you reside may have
    restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another
    country of encryption software.  Please check Your country’s laws,
    regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, use, and/or

10. GENERAL PROVISIONS.  This EULA is the complete and exclusive statement of
    the agreement between Esgyn and Customer regarding Customer’s download and
    use of the Licensed Software.  Should any provision of this EULA be declared
    unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed severable
    and severed from this EULA which shall otherwise remain in full force and
    effect.

11. GOVERNING LAW.  This EULA is governed by the laws of the State of California,
    without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.  Any action at law or in
    equity arising out of or relating to this EULA will be filed only in the
    state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, and Customer hereby
    irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
    jurisdiction of such courts. 

12. CHINA.  Notwithstanding Section 11 of this EULA, if the Customer is located
    in the PRC (as defined below), this Section 12 sets forth specific
    provisions as well as exceptions to the above terms and conditions.  The
    PRC means the People’s Republic of China, but excludes the Hong Kong Special
    Administrative Region, the Macau Special Administrative Region, and Chinese
    Tapei/Taiwan.  If you are located in the PRC and any of the provisions set
    forth in this Section 10 (a Local Provision) conflicts with any other term
    or provision of this EULA, the Local Provision supersedes such other term
    or condition with respect to any Licensed Software used in the PRC.

      GOVERNING LAW (SECTION 9): The following replaces this Section in its
      entirety: 

      Any conflicts arising out of this EULA shall be governed by the relevant
      officially promulgated laws, regulations, measures, and rules of the PRC,
      without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
      International Sale of Goods.  If a lawsuit arising out of this EULA is
      filed in the PRC, the parties hereby stipulate and agree that (a) any
      such suit or appeal therefrom must be brought in a division of the
      Supreme People’s Court of Shanghai, and (b) this EULA was executed and
      performed solely in the Shanghai Municipality.  In addition, you are
      solely responsible for (a) any registration, filing, disclosure, or
      approval of this Agreement required under the laws of the PRC, together
      with any and all associated costs and expenses, and (b) you understand
      and agree that Esgyn will be relieved from performance under this EULA
      if you fail to properly register, file, or disclose this EULA with local
      authorities in accordance with PRC law.  If you execute this EULA in
      Chinese, the Chinese version of this EULA controls over any English
      translation of the same.

13. CHANGING THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.  Esgyn reserves the right at any time to
    modify this EULA and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on
    your use of the Licensed Software. Such modifications and additional terms
    and conditions will be communicated to you and will be effective immediately
    and will be incorporated into this EULA. You agree that Esgyn shall not be
    liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of the
    Licensed Software.
