****************************** Apache Trafodion ******************************

Apache Trafodion is a webscale SQL-on-Hadoop solution enabling transactional or 
operational workloads on Hadoop.  The name "Trafodion" (the Welsh word for 
transactions, pronounced "Tra-vod-eee-on") was chosen specifically to emphasize 
the differentiation that Trafodion provides in closing a critical gap in the 
Hadoop ecosystem. Trafodion builds on the scalability, elasticity, and 
flexibility of Hadoop. Trafodion extends Hadoop to provide guaranteed 
transactional integrity, enabling new kinds of big data applications to run on 
Hadoop.
